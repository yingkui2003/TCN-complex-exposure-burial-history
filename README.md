## TCN complex exposure-burial history simulation tool
This tool was developed to simulate the complex exposure burial history based on measured Be and Al concentrations for bedrock/boulder surfaces that experienced the repeated coverages of glaciers or ice sheets. The detailed description of this tool can be found in 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169555X07004904 or the Geomorphology paper uploaded in this Github page.

This tool was developed by C++. You can download the exe file and run it in Windows. This site also includes two climate proxy record (DSDP607.dat and Global_Stack.dat) that can be used for the similation. If you have other climate ptoxy records, you can convert it to the same format to these two files.

You can double click the downloaded ClimateCurve.exe file and run it in Windows. When first runing it, the System may show a warning and just choose run it anyway. The following is the screenshot of the interface of this exe file:
